# Why?

Because I love to use LinkedIn Learning to improve my IT skills. 
But the structure of their  Exercise Files for  lessons made me crazy. So, I decided to make a script, which will move folders one level up and rename 
So, in about one and half hour (I forgot alot in bash and regexp without practice) I made a dumb bash script.

# How it works?

You have to place script into root directory of unpacked LiL EF.
Don't forget ``` chmod +x ./mv-me.sh```
And give any directory with LiL EF  to work like this:
```shell
./mv-me.sh __Ex__Files__SomeLiL__Course__
```
