# Why?

Because I love to use LinkedIn Learning to improve my skills in IT. 
But the structure of Exercise Files of their lessons made me crazy.
So, in about one and half hour (I forgot alt in bash and regexp without practice) I made a dumb bash script.
# How it works?

You have to place script into root directory of unpacked LiL EF.
Don't forget chmod +x ./mv-me.sh
And give any directory with LiL EF  to work like this:

./mv-me.sh __Ex__Files__SomeLiL__Course__
